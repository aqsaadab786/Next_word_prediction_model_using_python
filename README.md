# Next Word Prediction using Python and Deep Learning

## Description

Next Word Prediction is a language modeling task in Machine Learning that aims to predict the most probable word or sequence of words that follows a given input context. This project utilizes statistical patterns and deep learning techniques to generate accurate predictions based on the context provided.
The Next Word Prediction model has a range of applications across various industries. For example, it can be used in mobile keyboards to suggest the next word as you type, or in search engines to provide search suggestions as you type in the search bar. Next Word Prediction helps users communicate faster and more accurately by anticipating their next words.

## Dataset

The project uses a diverse dataset of text documents for training the model. The dataset was collected from various sources and preprocessed by cleaning and tokenizing the text data.

## Methodology

The project involves the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and tokenize the text data to prepare it for model training.
2. Data Preparation: Create input-output pairs from the text data for supervised learning.
3. Feature Engineering: Use word embeddings to represent words as numerical vectors.
4. Model Selection: Choose an appropriate deep learning model architecture (e.g., LSTM) for Next Word Prediction.
5. Model Training: Train the selected model on the dataset and adjust hyperparameters for optimal performance.
6. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as perplexity or accuracy.

## Results and Discussion

The model achieved promising results during testing, with high accuracy in predicting the next word based on the input context. However, further experimentation and optimization can be done to improve its performance.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different deep learning architectures and hyperparameter tuning.
- Explore using larger and more diverse datasets for training.
- Implement additional features or techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.

##Summary

Next word prediction is a language modelling task in Machine Learning that aims to predict the most probable word or sequence of words that follows a given input context. This task utilizes statistical patterns and linguistic structures to generate accurate predictions based on the context provided.
